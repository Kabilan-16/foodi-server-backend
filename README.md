My project Title is Restaurant Website and itâ€™s a web-based application designed to help users view restaurant menus and place orders online. The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

Backend Development (Server side):

The backend is built using Node.js and likely Express.js. It processes the requests coming from the frontend, such as retrieving restaurant data from the database, handling orders, or managing user profiles.
It acts as the brain of the application, communicating with the database, verifying user credentials, and sending the necessary data back to the frontend for display.

Main Purpose or Goal of the Project:

The goal of the Restaurant project is to create an easy-to-use platform where users can browse restaurants, view menus, and place orders online. It simplifies the food ordering process by providing a seamless and intuitive user experience from browsing to checkout
